---

## Capability Catalog

**45 Skills** (PDCA), **2 Templates** (one-shot), **1 Bundle** (kata). **48 capabilities total.**

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Skill** | PDCA FlowDef with convergence threshold + energy budget + loop action |
| **Template** | One-shot prompt execution, no registry manifest |
| **Bundle** | Composition orchestrator, delegates to sub-skills (non-PDCA) |

### Guardrails (activate first)

|-------|-----------------|
| **coding-guidelines** | Before writing or reviewing any code |

### Core Development

| Skill | When to Activate |

| **bug-hunt** | Bug hunting. Run expeditions against target crates. |
| **task-breakdown** | Decompose work into verifiable vertical-slice tasks with acceptance criteria. Convergent planning PDCA. |
| **tdd** | Building features or fixing bugs. RED→GREEN→REFACTOR. |
| **diagnose** | Debugging hard bugs or performance regressions. |
| **deep-module** | Module design. Deletion test, interface minimalism. |
| **refactor-service-layer** | Extracting duplicated logic from CLI/API/MCP surfaces. |

### Reasoning & Analysis

| Skill | When to Activate |
|-------|-----------------|
| **pragmatic-semantics** | Classify statements by certainty, constraint force, provenance. |
| **pragmatic-cybernetics** | Feedback loops, variety engineering, system homeostasis. |
| **pragmatic-laziness** | Find the path of least action through meaning-space. |

| **gpa-evolution** | Genetic-Pareto evolutionary optimization over text artifacts (prompts). NL reflection as gradient. |
| **media-workflow** | Multi-step media pipeline skill. Compose Fal.ai workflow DAGs from natural-language intent. |
| **logo-builder** (Template) | Pragmatic logo design. |
| **qa-script-builder** (Template) | Design autonomous QA pipeline manifests. |

## Prohibitions

From Magna Carta (P1–P4) and P12. Violations **must be deleted**.

| # | Prohibition | Principle |
|---|-------------|----------|
| 1 | No `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, `#[deprecated]`, unused traits, or stubs | P5 · P3 |
| 2 | No anonymous agency — every action has an authenticated author | P12 · P1 |
| 3 | No hidden parameters or admin-gated settings | P3 |
| 4 | No pass-through abstractions (deep-module discipline) | P5 · P7 |

### CI-Enforced Gates

Mechanical CI enforcement (inline steps in the `ci` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, not a separate job):

| Gate | Enforcement | Script |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Visual-UI/monitoring infrastructure prohibited | `grep` scan for grafana/prometheus/dashboard imports | inline in `ci.yml` |
| No hardcoded secrets | Environment variables or keystore only | inline in `ci.yml` |
| No `Result<_, String>` | Use `thiserror` enums for library errors | `scripts/check-string-errors.sh` |
| No unused crate dependencies | `nightly -D unused_crate_dependencies` | separate nightly job |
| MCP servers must have tool-behavior contract tests | `Parameters(` seam present in `mcp-servers/*/tests/` | `scripts/check-mcp-tool-tests.sh` (ratcheted allowlist) |

Prohibitions #1–#4 above are design discipline. Only #1 is partially CI-gated via `clippy -D warnings` (catches `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()`). Prohibitions #2–#4 are enforced by code review, not mechanical gates.

## Tooling Policy

hKask is a Rust project. Python is **not** an acceptable project dependency. Ad-hoc Python scripts are permitted during exploration but must be deleted before work is complete. Ad-hoc generated artifacts (one-off JSON inventories, scratch manifests) must also be removed. Permanent generated docs under `docs/generated/` and skill `manifest.yaml` files are part of the system and excluded.

Preferred auxiliary tooling: shell (`bash`) under `scripts/`, Rust binaries or `build.rs` for source/Cargo metadata.
