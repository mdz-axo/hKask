# todo — Replicant→UserPod Consolidation (FINAL, Phase 0 resolved)

> Advisory. Each slice flagged for user accept/reject. No autonomous deletion.
> Order = gpa-evolution iter 3: types-first, principles as own phase.

## Phase 0 — RESOLVED (no code)
- [x] **T0.1** 1:1 userpod (multi-persona removed); A2A transport kept (userpods present as agents); no crate rename; persistent userpods; curator = systemd daemon. — *Done*

## Phase 1 — Foundation types
- [x] **T1.1a** Rename `ReplicantIdentity`→`UserPod` + strangler-fig alias `pub type ReplicantIdentity = UserPod;` (hkask-identity). *Workspace build GREEN; alias removed in Phase 6.* — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [x] **T1.1b** Drop `is_primary` from API surface (S-1to1-b) + CLI prints (S-1to1-c). Switcher removed from terminal UI. *Committed 0c06d9f7; workspace green.* — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [ ] **T1.1c (deferred migration)** Drop `is_primary` field from `UserPod` + `user_store.rs` mapping + DB column — *deferred per user decision (leave DB column for now)*
- [x] **T1.1d (cleanup)** Remove orphan `#replicant-select` CSS rule at `terminal.rs:229` — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [x] **S-AK-a** Drop `agent_type` from `A2AAgent` + `register_agent` signature (a2a/mod.rs); from `AgentPod`+`new()`+`register()` (pod/mod.rs); from `PodStatusInfo`+2 constructions+`activate_pod` (active_pods.rs); fix 9 callers (registry_loader, onboarding, token.rs, reg_wallet.rs, api a2a.rs/pods.rs, repl agent.rs/pod.rs). *AgentKind enum retained (persona system) — deleted in T2.2.* *Workspace green; a2a 11/11 + agents tests green. Committed ce7cd7ba by concurrent process.* — *Done 2026-07-20*

## Phase 2 — UserPod runtime (focus obstacle, early)
- [x] **T2.0** Consumer trace written to `tasks/consumer-trace.md` (ReplicantIdentity/AgentKind/is_primary/list_replicants) — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [ ] **T2.1** Fold `AgentPod`+`PodDeployment`→`UserPod` (deep: SQLCipher+CNS+capability); persistent (no Deactivated). Rewrite `agent_pod_integration.rs`→`userpod_integration.rs`, `pod_portability.rs` — *Acc: UserPod deploys+persists; tests green; ≤5 files; checkpoint: User*
- [ ] **T2.2** Delete persona from userpods; rename `AgentPersona`→`CuratorPersona` (curator-only). Remove persona-YAML from userpod creation; userpod presents in A2A via WebID+name+capabilities only — *Acc: no persona on userpods; curator persona intact; ≤4 files*

## Phase 3 — Curator daemon promotion
- [ ] **T3.1** Promote curator OUT of `PodKind::Curator` to first-class systemd daemon (`kask serve` already generates unit at `init.rs:180`); `CuratorSync` polls UserPods via `curator_index`. Keep test harness — *Acc: `kask serve` runs curator; CuratorSync green vs UserPod; ≤5 files; checkpoint: User*

## Phase 4 — A2A + lifecycle
- [ ] **T4.0 (DISCOVERY, gates T4.2)** Define pod-offline behavior (Q-LIFE-DISC): 1-page design doc with options — (a) pod sleeps (storage-at-rest, no compute, no A2A), (b) pod runs headless (A2A-reachable, no inference), (c) maintenance mode for inactive-not-cancelled. User picks one — *Acc: design doc with chosen option; checkpoint: UserFeedbackOccurrence*
- [ ] **T4.1** A2A: keep transport; delete Bot registration path; userpods + curator register as agents (no `AgentKind`) — *Acc: no Bot path; userpod+curator A2A register; MCP tools unaffected; ≤4 files*
- [ ] **T4.2** Collapse `PodLifecycleState`→persistent + register-on-start, per T4.0 decision (≤2–3 states incl. offline state); remove `Deactivated`/teardown — *Acc: states match T4.0 design; tests green; ≤3 files; checkpoint: User*

## Phase 5 — Principles + docs (in scope per user)
- [x] **T5.1** Edit P6 "Space for Replicants & Bots"→"Space for UserPods" + P6.1 1:1 (`PRINCIPLES.md:128-131`); P5.2 "Who" drop replicant/bot (`:83`); P9 authority (`:200`) — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [x] **T5.2** Refocus P10 Bot/Replicant Taxonomy → **P10 User Agency** (`PRINCIPLES.md:206-208`); Twelve Principles stay twelve — *Done 2026-07-20 (folded into T5.1 edit pass)*
- [x] **T5.3a** Retitle P12→"Authenticated Host Mandate"; rewrite P12.1 surface-host table (drop Bot row; CLI=user+curator, Daemon=curator, API=userpods) (`PRINCIPLES.md:214-230`) — *Done 2026-07-20 (folded into T5.1 edit pass)*
- [x] **T5.3b** Rewrote mandate doc as `docs/architecture/mandates/P12-authenticated-host-mandate.md` (old `P12-replicant-host-mandate.md` was a dangling reference — dir didn't exist); fixed `PRINCIPLES.md:219` citation — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [x] **T5.4 (core)** Swept code comments: `deployment.rs:11` (P6→UserPods), `openapi.rs:59` (P12→Authenticated), `identity/lib.rs:226` (P6→UserPods), `ports/registry.rs:110-113` (userpod/human-users), `mcp/runtime.rs:247` (P12→authenticated-host), `test-harness/lib.rs:17` (P12→Authenticated), `tui/windows/chat.rs:16` (P12→Authenticated), `FUNCTIONAL_SPECIFICATION.md:1412,1433` (P12→Authenticated). *Workspace green.* — *Done 2026-07-20*
- [ ] **T5.4 (remaining docs)** `TESTING_DISCIPLINE.md:249,296,299`, `hKask-architecture-master.md:2659,2906,2910,2912`, `architecture-patterns.md:479` — principle-cited doc references still name Replicant/Bot (low-risk doc consistency; deferred to avoid racing concurrent doc edits)
- [ ] **T5.5** Sweep skill docs: `attack-taxonomy-mapper`, `runtime-posture-monitor`, `supply-chain-sentinel` — rename `replicant_host` span field per Q-SPAN — *Acc: skills consistent; ≤3 files; checkpoint: User*

## Phase 6 — Surface rewiring + verification
- [ ] **T6.1** `hkask-api/routes/replicant.rs`→`routes/userpod.rs`; remove `list_replicants` + terminal switcher — *Acc: API green; ≤4 files*
- [ ] **T6.2** `hkask-cli ReplicantAction`→`UserPodAction` — *Acc: CLI green; ≤3 files*
- [ ] **T6.3** `hkask-tui ReplicaDataBridge`→`UserPodDataBridge` — *Acc: TUI builds + smoke; ≤4 files; checkpoint: User*
- [ ] **T6.4** Full verify: `cargo build --workspace`; `cargo test`; TUI flows; record `metric_after` — *Acc: green; metric_after JSON*

## Verification gates (every 2–3 slices)
- [ ] Build passes after Phase 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- [ ] TUI flows (register, login, terminal, skills, MCP) end-to-end after T6.3
- [ ] No `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()`/`#[deprecated]` introduced (P5)
- [ ] No `Result<_, String>` introduced (CI gate)
- [ ] Every userpod action retains authenticated author (P12-as-retitled) — CNS spans audited
- [ ] `scripts/check-cns-canonical.sh` passes after span field rename (T5.5)
- [ ] TUI compile time ≤ metric_before
