### Domain Ownership Rules

Each contract carries a **motivating principle** in its ID prefix and **constraining principles** in its body annotations.

1. **P9 (Homeostatic Self-Regulation)** owns all CNS regulation-loop contracts: energy, algedonic, runtime, circuit breaker, API metering, energy estimation
2. **P4 (Clear Boundaries)** owns all membrane/boundary contracts: governed_tool, governed_inference
3. **P8 (Semantic Grounding)** owns all type-level identity contracts: `EnergyCost`, `EnergyDelta` newtypes
4. **P12 (Subscriber Consent)** owns all subscriber/consent contracts: `subscribe`, `subscribe_async`
5. **P3 (Generative Space)** owns all sync/blocking variants and content-domain contracts: blocking accessors, storage, memory, CLI
6. **P7 (Evolutionary Architecture)** owns all configurable-from-real-usage contracts: threshold calibration, replenish rate tuning

A contract may have **one motivating principle** and **multiple constraining principles**. The motivating principle determines the ID prefix (`P{N}`). Constraining principles appear as `[P{N}]` annotations in the contract body.

## 3. Non-CNS Domain Stubs

These domains are documented here for completeness. Most contracts are already realigned to `P{N}-*-` namespaces; the remaining cleanup is the legacy `SVC-*`, `svc-*`, `MUST-*`, and bare `P9`/`P3` IDs in `hkask-services` plus any straggler non-`P{N}` IDs in `hkask-agents` and `hkask-inference`.

### 3.1 Wallet (`hkask-wallet`)

**Motivating Principle:** P9 (Homeostatic Self-Regulation) — rJoule balance, encumbrance, and fee estimation form the wallet's energy regulation loop
**Constraining Principles:** P1 (User Sovereignty), P2 (Affirmative Consent), P4 (Clear Boundaries), P8 (Semantic Grounding)
**Crate:** `hkask-wallet`
**Sources:** `src/manager.rs`, `src/issuer.rs`, `src/signing.rs`, `src/hinkal.rs`, `src/price_feed.rs`, `src/hedera.rs`, `src/solana.rs`, `tests/hinkal_adapter.rs`

> **Note:** The original handoff estimated 10 template contracts; the actual source contains **53 production** and **25 test** unique contract IDs. All carry P3 as the motivating principle; boundary/semantic concerns appear as P4/P8 constraining annotations. Pre-existing ID collisions (`TPL-001`/`TPL-002`/`TPL-011` reused across unrelated functions) were resolved by assigning distinct `P3-tpl-*` IDs.

### 3.6 MCP Servers (`mcp-servers/`)

**18 contracts** — P5 (Essentialism)
- `hkask-mcp-research` — web research agent (P5)
- `hkask-mcp-spec` — specification document server (P5)
- `hkask-mcp-condenser` — context compression agent (P5)
- Tool registration, capability declaration, resource serving

### 3.7 Service Layer (`hkask-services`)

**305+ contracts** — P5 + P7 (Essentialism + Evolution) plus mixed P1/P2/P3/P4/P9 concerns because the service layer wraps many underlying domains.

The crate currently contains legacy ID namespaces (`SVC-*`, `svc-*`, `MUST-*`, `MDS-*`, `BACKUP-*`, `lifecycle-*`, `services-settings-*`, bare `P9`/`P3`) that need migration to the canonical `P{N}-svc-*` form. This is the largest remaining realignment target.

Representative domains:
- `AgentLifecycleService` — agent creation, monitoring, teardown
- `CnsService` — CNS health, alerts, variety, budget queries
- `KeystoreService` — key management and signing operations
- `WalletService` — wallet operation orchestration
- `BackupService`, `BundleService`, `ChatService`, `ComposeService`, `CuratorService`, `DiscoverService`, `EmbedService`, `GoalService`, `KataEngine`, `OnboardingService`, `PodService`, `SchedulerService`, `SkillService`, `SovereigntyService`, `SpecService`, `VerificationService`
- Service registration pattern: all services are discovered, not coupled

### 3.8 Agents (`hkask-agents`)

**30 contracts** — agents span four motivating principles:
- **P1 (User Sovereignty)** — `AgentPod`, `PodManager`, `SovereigntyChecker`
- **P2 (Affirmative Consent)** — `ConsentRecord`, `ConsentManager`
- **P4 (Clear Boundaries)** — ACP runtime, root authority, MCP capability adapters
- **P9 (Homeostatic Self-Regulation)** — Curator, Metacognition, LoopSystem, BotHealth, prompt classification

**Crate:** `hkask-agents` | **Sources:** `src/consent.rs`, `src/sovereignty.rs`, `src/loop_system.rs`, `src/prompt_analysis.rs`, `src/registry_loader.rs`, `src/acp/**/*.rs`, `src/curator/**/*.rs`, `src/curator_agent/**/*.rs`, `src/pod/**/*.rs`, `src/adapters/**/*.rs`, `src/ports/memory_storage.rs`, `tests/agent_pod_integration.rs`

**Total CNS contracts:** 99 (across all 9 source files).
**Total wallet contracts:** 23 production occurrences (11 unique IDs).
**Total agents contracts:** 174 production occurrences (30 unique IDs).
**Total storage contracts:** 247 production occurrences (168 unique IDs).
**Total memory contracts:** 67 production occurrences (52 unique production IDs + 16 test IDs).
**Total inference contracts:** 95 occurrences (63 unique production IDs + 31 unique test IDs).
**Total templates contracts:** 80 occurrences (53 unique production IDs + 25 unique test IDs).
**Build status:** `cargo check -p hkask-cns`, `cargo check -p hkask-wallet`, `cargo check -p hkask-agents`, `cargo check -p hkask-storage`, `cargo check -p hkask-memory`, `cargo check -p hkask-inference`, and `cargo check -p hkask-templates` pass clean.

### 4.2 Idempotent Migration

The contract ID migration is **idempotent** — the same source file can be reread at any time and the same contract IDs will be extracted. There is no stateful migration step. The contract IDs exist in the source code, not in a database.

### 4.3 Cross-Crate Dependencies

All hKask crates depend on `hkask-types` for the canonical `CnsSpan` registry, `WebID` identity type, and port definitions. The CNS contracts are **leaf nodes** — they do not depend on any other crates. Realignment does not change any downstream crate's behavior.

## 5. Contract ID Format Appendix

### 5.1 Formal Specification

Every contract ID follows the pattern:

```
P{N} - {domain-short} - {operation}
```

Where:
- **P{N}** — The motivating principle (1–12). This determines which principle **owns** the contract and appears in the ID prefix.
- **{domain-short}** — Abbreviated domain name (e.g., `energy`, `algedonic`, `runtime`, `gov-tool`, `gov-inf`, `circuit`, `api`, `est`).
- **{operation}** — Verb phrase describing what the contract does (e.g., `new`, `can-proceed`, `settle`, `calibrate`).

Constraining principles appear in the contract body as `[P{N}] Constraining: ...` annotations. A contract may have:
- **One motivating principle** (the ID prefix)
- **Multiple constraining principles** (body annotations)

### 5.2 Principle Legend

| # | Principle | Role in CNS |
|---|----------|------------|
| P1 | User Sovereignty | User owns their data, decisions, and identity |
| P2 | Affirmative Consent | Every action requires explicit user consent |
| P3 | Generative Space | The system can create, modify, and destroy state |
| P4 | Clear Boundaries | Modules own their domains; boundaries are enforced |
| P5 | Essentialism | Remove everything that does not earn its existence |
| P6 | (Reserved) | Not yet assigned to CNS contracts |
| P7 | Evolutionary Architecture | Parameters emerge from real usage, not speculation |
| P8 | Semantic Grounding | Types carry meaning; newtypes prevent confusion |
| P9 | Homeostatic Self-Regulation | Feedback loops maintain system stability |
| P10 | (Reserved) | Not yet assigned to CNS contracts |
| P11 | (Reserved) | Not yet assigned to CNS contracts |
| P12 | Subscriber Consent | Observers register through explicit subscription |

### 5.3 Validation Rules

1. **Unique contract IDs** — No two contracts share the same ID.
2. **Idempotent** — Reading the same source file twice produces the same IDs.
3. **Stable** — Contract IDs persist across code changes unless the contract's purpose changes.
4. **Derivable** — IDs can be derived from `grep "REQ:" crates/hkask-cns/src/*.rs`.

### 5.4 Notational Conventions

- **Production contracts** are labeled `P{N}-{domain}-{operation}` in the contract body (e.g., `P9-cns-energy-budget-new`, `P9-wallet-mgr-build`).
- **Test contracts** are labeled `P{N}-{domain}-{operation}-test` or have a `-T{N}` suffix.
- **Blocking variants** use the P3 prefix: `P3-cns-{domain}-blocking-{operation}`.
- **Calibrate contracts** use the P7 prefix: `P7-cns-{domain}-calibrate-{operation}`.
- **Subscriber contracts** use the P12 prefix: `P12-cns-{domain}-subscribe-{operation}`.

### 5.5 Future Domains

The following domains are **not yet realigned** and will use their own principle prefixes:
- `hkask-storage` (P3): `P3-storage-*`
- `hkask-memory` (P3): `P3-memory-*`
- `hkask-agents` (P1): `P1-agents-*`
- `hkask-inference` (P9+P4): `P9/P4-inference-*`
- `hkask-templates` (P3): `P3-templates-*`
- `hkask-services` (P5+P7): `P5/P7-services-*`
- `hkask-api` (P1+P4): `P1/P4-api-*`
- `hkask-comm` (P1): `P1-comm-*`
- `hkask-keystore` (P1): `P1-keystore-*`
- `kask` CLI (P3): `P3-cli-*`
- `mcp-servers/` (P5): `P5-mcp-*`

- `hkask-wallet` is **complete** as of this revision: `P9-wallet-*`.
- `hkask-agents` is **complete** as of this revision: `P1-agt-*`, `P2-agt-*`, `P3-agt-*`, `P4-agt-*`, `P9-agt-*`.
- `hkask-storage` is **complete** as of this revision: `P1-sto-*`, `P2-sto-*`, `P3-sto-*`, `P4-sto-*`, `P8-sto-*`.
- `hkask-memory` is **complete** as of this revision: `P3-mem-*`.
- `hkask-inference` is **complete** as of this revision: `P9-inf-*`, `P4-inf-*`.
- `hkask-services` is **not yet realigned**: still contains `SVC-*`, `svc-*`, `MUST-*`, `MDS-*`, `BACKUP-*`, `lifecycle-*`, `services-settings-*`, and bare `P9`/`P3` IDs.
