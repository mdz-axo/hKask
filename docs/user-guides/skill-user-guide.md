# hKask Skill User Guide

**Purpose:** How to discover, load, and use skills in hKask. Covers the `kask skill` CLI, skill list, activation triggers, the dual-layer runtime model, and a catalog of all 45 available skills organized by functional category.

**Companion doc:** [`skill-designer-guide.md`](../../docs/guides/skill-designer-guide.md) — for creating and maintaining skills.

---

## 1. What Are Skills?

Skills are composable agent capabilities. They teach the Zed coding agent domain knowledge and provide runtime-executable templates for the hKask engine. Skills live in two layers:

| Layer | You interact with it via... | Example |
|-------|---------------------------|---------|
| **Zed agent layer** (SKILL.md) | The `skill` tool in Zed — "Use coding-guidelines" | Teaches the agent Karpathy's four coding principles |
| **Registry template layer** (`.j2` + `manifest.yaml`) | The `kask` CLI and runtime engine | Renders a KnowAct template to assess code quality |

A skill may have one or both layers. You don't need to know which — the system handles routing.

### 1.1 Skill Architecture Layers

Skills are organized into five composition layers, running top-to-bottom:

```
Perceptual  →  dokkodo-mindset (clears attachment, preference, fear)
Regulative  →  constraint-forces (enforces boundaries across all layers)
Analytic    →  pragmatic-laziness, essentialist, grill-me, mcda
Executive   →  coding-guidelines, domain skills, task-specific skills
Governance  →  magna-carta-verifier, pragmatic-semantics/cybernetics
```

Skills at higher layers feed clarified perception to lower layers. `constraint-forces` runs across all layers — Prohibitions and Guardrails are never relaxed.

### 1.2 The Essential Five — Skills Every Agent Should Know

Start here. These five skills compose together into the most common workflow and teach the foundational patterns:

| # | Skill | Why it matters | First trigger to try |
|---|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1 | `dokkodo-mindset` | Clears attachment, preference, and fear before analysis — transforms how you see the problem | "apply the Dokkodo" |
| 2 | `pragmatic-laziness` | Finds the path of least action through any design or decision | "be lazy about this" |
| 3 | `essentialist` | Deletes what doesn't earn its existence — the deletion test | "simplify this" |
| 4 | `coding-guidelines` | Constrains HOW you code — think first, keep it simple, touch only what you must | "use coding-guidelines" |
| 5 | `constraint-forces` | Classifies every constraint so you know what's inviolable and what's negotiable | "what force is this constraint?" |

**The primary chain:** `dokkodo-mindset` → `pragmatic-laziness` → `essentialist` → `coding-guidelines`, with `constraint-forces` running across all stages. Learn these five and you can navigate any hKask task.

### 1.3 Why Some Skills Lack SKILL.md

Of the ~74 registry crates in `registry/templates/`, 45 have SKILL.md companions in `.agents/skills/`. The remaining ~29 are **infrastructure crates** — runtime dispatch, storage, monitoring, and orchestration templates that run the system rather than perform user-facing tasks. A skill with only a registry crate (`.j2` + `manifest.yaml`) is runtime-complete — the cascade can execute it. The SKILL.md is a **generated companion** for the Zed coding agent during development. When both exist, the registry crate is authoritative. See `hKask-architecture-master.md` Pattern A for the full derivation rule.

---

## 2. Discovering Skills

### 2.1 List All Skills

```bash
kask skill list
```

Output shows name, visibility, description, and activation trigger for every installed skill.

### 2.2 Show Skill Details

```bash
kask skill show coding-guidelines
```

Displays the full SKILL.md content, template inventory, and contract signatures.

### 2.3 Filter by Visibility

```bash
kask skill list --visibility Public     # Shared/discoverable skills
kask skill list --visibility Private    # Your personal/namespace skills
```

---

## 3. Activating a Skill

### 3.1 In Zed (Agent Layer)

Skills activate when a Zed agent's prompt matches the skill's `description` trigger. You can also explicitly invoke:

```
Use the coding-guidelines skill before reviewing this PR.
```

The Zed agent loads `SKILL.md`, absorbs the procedural knowledge, and applies it to the task.

### 3.2 Via the kask CLI (Registry Layer)

```bash
kask skill invoke coding-guidelines/guidelines-assess --input task_description="review auth module"
```

Renders the `.j2` template with your input, executes through the inference router, returns structured output.

### 3.3 Via Bundles

Bundles compose multiple skills into workflows:

```bash
kask bundle run kata-pattern --bot Alice
```

The `kata-pattern` bundle routes to `kata-starter`, `kata-improvement`, or `kata-coaching` based on the bot's automaticity score.

## 5. Composition Patterns

Skills don't work in isolation. Here are the three most common chains:

### Pattern 1: Perception → Analysis → Action

```
dokkodo-mindset → pragmatic-laziness → essentialist → coding-guidelines
     ↑                                                    ↑
constraint-forces runs across all stages, never relaxed
```

**When:** You face a design decision, architecture problem, or code review. The Dokkodo clears your perceptual field. Pragmatic laziness finds the least-action path. Essentialist deletes what doesn't earn existence. Coding guidelines enforce discipline throughout.

### Pattern 2: Forecast → Decide → Record → Verify

```
superforecasting → mcda → decision-journal → goal-analysis
```

**When:** You're making a consequential decision under uncertainty. Superforecasting produces calibrated probabilities. MCDA ranks alternatives on weighted criteria. The decision journal records the reasoning and schedules a revisit. Goal analysis tracks whether the outcome matches the prediction.

### Pattern 3: Diagnose → Extract → Fix → Harden

```
diagnose → structured-extraction → refactor-service-layer → adversarial-red-team
```

**When:** Something broke. Diagnose finds the bug. Structured extraction maps the incident to a root cause schema. Refactor-service-layer fixes it systematically. Adversarial red-team tests whether the fix holds under attack.

### Pattern 4: Explore → Summarize → Compress

```
zoom-out → chain-of-density → caveman
```

**When:** You need to understand a large unfamiliar codebase and communicate it concisely. Zoom out for context. Chain-of-density for maximum factual density. Caveman for final stylistic compression.

## 7. Understanding Template Types

When a skill has registry templates, each `.j2` file is typed:

| Type | What It Does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **WordAct** | Produces text or structured output | `superforecasting/stage_7_record.j2` — creates forecast record |
| **KnowAct** | Reasons, classifies, evaluates, decides | `dokkodo-mindset/dokkodo-perceive.j2` — applies perceptual filter |
| **FlowDef** | Orchestrates WordAct/KnowAct in a pipeline | `essentialist/essentialist-flow.j2` — iterates G1→G2→G3 gates |

You rarely need to know the template type — the runtime dispatches correctly. But when debugging: WordAct = "what to say", KnowAct = "how to think", FlowDef = "what to do".

---

## 8. Visibility and P11

Every skill has a visibility field:

| Visibility | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `Public` | Discoverable and usable by all agents and users |
| `Private` | Only usable by the owning replicant or namespace |

P11 (Digital Public/Private Sphere) governs this. You control what is shared via explicit consent boundaries.

---

## 9. Checking Skill Health

### 9.1 CNS Health

```bash
kask cns health
```

Shows CNS span health for all active skills.

### 9.2 Schema Validation

```bash
cargo test -p hkask-templates yaml_schema_validation
```

Validates all manifest YAML files. Run after installing new skills.

### 9.3 Contract Audit

Contracts use `expect:` + `[P{N}]` annotations. Verify coverage with:

```bash
# Count functions with principle grounding
grep -rn "/// \[P[0-9]*\]" crates/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l

# Check expect: field presence
grep -rn "/// expect:" crates/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l
```

Run the contract-generator (contract-generator/contract-generator.j2) for any gaps.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Skill doesn't appear in `kask skill list` | Not registered or visibility mismatch | Check `visibility` field and registry bootstrap |
| "Template render failed" | `.j2` has prohibited `template_type` | Must be `WordAct` or `KnowAct` (not `FlowDef`) |
| "Permission denied" | Visibility mismatch (P11) | Check `visibility` in SKILL.md frontmatter |
| Bundle doesn't compose | Constituent skill score < threshold | Calibrate constituent skills first |
| Two skills with same name | Duplicate installation | Use `kask skill list` to identify and prune |
