# Test-Driven Development

Adapted from Matt Pocock's TDD skill.

**Anchoring discipline:** [`docs/architecture/core/TESTING_DISCIPLINE.md`](../../docs/architecture/core/TESTING_DISCIPLINE.md) — Design by Contract (Meyer, 1986), verified through Property-Based Testing (QuickCheck, Claessen & Hughes, 2000). This skill defines the *process* for writing tests. The Testing Discipline defines *what* the tests must verify: contracts (preconditions, postconditions, invariants).

## Registry Templates

This skill's runtime templates live in `registry/templates/tdd/`:

| Template | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|--------|
| `tdd-plan.j2` | KnowAct | Plan TDD cycle: extract requirements from specs, prioritize by risk |
| `tdd-tracer.j2` | KnowAct | Execute tracer bullet: write one contract, then one failing test, then minimal code to pass |
| `tdd-refactor.j2` | KnowAct | Refactor while GREEN: extract duplication, deepen modules |
| `tdd-verify.j2` | KnowAct | Verify TDD cycle completion: tests pass, clippy clean, spec traceability |
| `tdd-gap-check.j2` | KnowAct | Functional gap analysis: compare spec requirements against tested behaviors |

The SKILL.md (this file) teaches the Zed coding agent the TDD methodology. The .j2 templates are executable process steps the hKask runtime invokes during `kask chat` sessions.

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests verify behavioral contracts through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; contracts shouldn't.

**Anchoring discipline:** [`docs/architecture/core/TESTING_DISCIPLINE.md`](../../docs/architecture/core/TESTING_DISCIPLINE.md) — Design by Contract (Meyer, 1986), verified through Property-Based Testing (QuickCheck, Claessen & Hughes, 2000). This skill defines the *process* for writing tests. The Testing Discipline defines *what* the tests must verify: contracts (preconditions, postconditions, invariants).

**Contract-first ordering:** Write the contract before the test. The contract is the specification of the test. Without a contract, the test verifies *something*, but it's not clear what. Order: (1) Contract → (2) Property-Based Test → (3) Implementation.

**Good tests** are property-based: they verify that a contract holds for all valid inputs, not just hand-picked examples. They describe *what* the system guarantees, not *how* it achieves it. A good test reads like an executable contract. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are example-based and coupled to implementation. They test specific input-output pairs rather than invariants. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

**Probabilistic contracts** extend Design by Contract for non-deterministic functions — e.g., LLM agent behaviors, inference output validation, improv mode compliance. Per Testing Discipline §7.6, these use `(p, δ, k)`-satisfaction:
- `p`: Probability threshold (e.g., 0.95 = contract must hold in 95% of executions)
- `δ`: Tolerance bound (how far from the postcondition is acceptable)
- `k`: Recovery window (how many steps the agent has to self-correct before violation is reported)

Probabilistic contracts use the same `/// REQ:` doc-comment format with an additional `prob:` field:
```rust
/// REQ: improv-plussing-001
/// pre:  mode is Plussing, context is non-empty
/// post: response builds on input (yes-and pattern) with prob ≥ 0.90
/// prob: p=0.90, δ=semantic_similarity≥0.7, k=3
pub async fn plussing_respond(&self, input: &str) -> String { ... }
```

Only apply probabilistic contracts to LLM agent behaviors or other non-deterministic functions. Deterministic functions use standard contracts without `prob:`.

### Contract Architecture — Principles as Terms

Every contract is a **smart contract between code and user expectation**, with hKask's 12 architectural principles as the governing terms (PRINCIPLES.md §1.5). A contract has four layers, each answering a distinct question:

| Layer | Field | Question Answered |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Verbal expectation** | `expect:` with `[P{N}]` tag | What did the user say they want? (in the user's voice) |
| **Goal principle** | inline `[P{N}]` on `expect:` | Which principle justifies this as a user-visible guarantee? |
| **Constraining principles** | `[P{N}] Constraining:` | What can the code *not* do and stay principle-aligned? |
| **Behavioral specification** | `pre:` / `post:` / `inv:` | What are the caller's obligations and the function's guarantees? |

A complete contract:

```rust
/// REQ: P9-cns-energy-budget-can-proceed
/// expect: "I can check whether an agent has enough gas before executing" [P9]
/// pre:  gas is a valid EnergyCost
/// post: returns true iff budget has >= gas remaining and circuit breaker allows
/// inv:  does not consume gas (read-only check)
/// [P4] Constraining: Clear Boundaries — cap enforces resource boundary
/// [P3] Constraining: Generative Space — cap is user-visible, not hidden
pub fn can_proceed(&self, gas: EnergyCost) -> bool { ... }
```

**Contract ID format** (FUNCTIONAL_SPECIFICATION.md §7): `P{N}-{domain-abbreviation}-{operation-verb-phrase}`. The `P{N}` prefix encodes the goal principle directly in the ID.

The TDD's role is to ensure every tracer bullet produces a contract with all four layers and validates each:
- Does `expect:` faithfully capture the spec requirement in the user's voice?
- Does the `[P{N}]` tag on `expect:` correctly identify the goal principle?
- Do `[P{N}] Constraining:` annotations correctly express what principles forbid?
- Do `pre:` / `post:` / `inv:` form a machine-checkable behavioral specification?
- Does the implementation satisfy the behavioral specification without violating constraining principles?

### Spec-Anchored Testing

Every tracer bullet starts from a specification requirement, not from intuition. The specification is the source of truth for *what* to test. Without spec anchoring, tests validate behavior that may not matter and miss behavior that does.

**Traceability chain**: `spec/goal/capture` → `Spec` objects → `GoalSpec.criteria` → `// REQ:` comment → test → implementation.

The TDD process queries the specification infrastructure before planning. Requirements come from structured `Spec` and `GoalSpec` objects — not from LLM interpretation of markdown. All five MDS §3 tools are available via the `hkask-mcp-spec` MCP server:

- `spec/goal/capture` — creates a new specification with auto-inferred MDS category and criteria seeding
- `spec/goal/decompose` — breaks a goal into ordered sub-goals with dependencies
- `spec/graph/query` — queries specs by text match across name, goals, and category, returning graph nodes/edges/paths
- `spec/graph/coherence` — computes collection coherence, identifies missing categories and incomplete specs
- `spec/require/writing-quality` — gates spec readability before testing

These tools are also exposed via the HTTP API (`/api/specs` routes). Curation decisions (Accept/Revise/Reject) are external to the spec server — the Curator or human makes them (MDS §2).

If no specification exists for the feature, use `spec/goal/capture` to create one before planning tests. A feature without a spec cannot be spec-anchored.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" — treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:
- Tests written in bulk test *imagined* behavior, not *actual* behavior
- You end up testing the *shape* of things rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes — they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Rust Conventions

1. Use `#[cfg(test)]` module for unit tests alongside the code they test.
2. Use `tests/` directory for integration tests that exercise crate public APIs.
3. Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests.
4. Use `tempfile` for tests needing filesystem — never write to the project tree. Use `hkask-test-harness` (provides `TestDb` and other test fixtures) for database and persistence tests per Testing Discipline §8.3 T9.
5. Prefer `assert!` with meaningful messages over `assert_eq!` when the message adds diagnostic value.
6. Test error paths — verify error variants, not just happy paths.
7. **No `todo!()` or `unimplemented!()`** — write minimal stubs that return sensible defaults or errors, not panics.
8. **Every test carries a `// REQ:` comment** naming the contract it validates. Format: `// REQ: <contract_id> — requirement summary`. The `contract_id` uses `P{N}-{domain}-{operation}` format (FUNCTIONAL_SPECIFICATION.md §7).

## Workflow

### 1. Spec-Anchored Planning

Before writing any code:

**Step 1 — Extract requirements from specifications:**
- Identify the relevant specification document(s) for the change
- Extract functional requirements with their MDS category and spec_id (e.g., from `spec/goal/capture` output)
- If no spec exists, create a minimal one before proceeding

**Step 2 — Map requirements to testable behaviors:**
- Each functional requirement maps to one or more observable behaviors on a public seam
- If a requirement has no testable behavior, deepen the module first
- Confirm with user what interface changes are needed

**Step 3 — Prioritize by risk:**
- P0 (Security/correctness-critical): Trust & Security, fail-closed behavior
- P1 (Correctness): Interface parity, core algorithms
- P2+ (Ergonomics): Convenience, polish

**Step 4 — List behaviors with traceability:**
- Each behavior must reference a spec_id from the specification
- List behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- Get user approval on the plan

Ask: "Which MDS categories does this change touch? What should the public interface look like? Which requirements are most critical to test?"

**Spec resolution:** Before writing any test plan, query the spec infrastructure for requirements in the relevant MDS category. Use `spec/graph/query` (via the `hkask-mcp-spec` MCP server) to retrieve structured requirements. Use `spec/graph/coherence` to verify collection health. Curation decisions (Accept/Revise/Reject) are made externally by the Curator or human per MDS §2. Only plan tracer bullets for specs with `Accept` curation decisions.

**You can't test everything.** Focus on requirements in the change scope, prioritized by risk.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE contract and ONE test that confirm ONE thing about the system:

```
CONTRACT: Write the full contract on the function signature — expect:, pre/post/inv, [P{N}] Constraining
RED:     Write property-based test verifying the behavioral specification → test fails
GREEN:   Write minimal code to satisfy the contract without violating constraining principles → test passes
```

Each contract must include:
- `/// REQ: P{N}-{domain}-{operation}` — contract ID with goal principle prefix
- `/// expect:` — the user's functional expectation in their own voice, with inline `[P{N}]` tag naming the goal principle
- `/// pre:` and `/// post:` — the behavioral specification (Testing Discipline §1.2)
- `/// inv:` — type invariants where applicable
- `/// [P{N}] Constraining:` — principles that constrain how the goal is delivered (zero to many)

The goal principle is encoded twice: once in the contract ID `P{N}` prefix, and once as a `[P{N}]` tag on the `expect:` line. They must match. Per PRINCIPLES.md §1.5, the goal principle answers "What does the user get?" — every other principle constrains *how* it's delivered.

For non-deterministic functions (LLM agent behaviors, inference output), add `/// prob: p=X, δ=Y, k=Z` per Testing Discipline §7.6.

```rust
/// REQ: P9-cns-energy-budget-can-proceed
/// expect: "I can check whether an agent has enough gas before executing" [P9]
/// pre:  gas is a valid EnergyCost
/// post: returns true iff budget has >= gas remaining and circuit breaker allows
/// inv:  does not consume gas (read-only check)
/// [P4] Constraining: Clear Boundaries — cap enforces resource boundary
pub fn can_proceed(&self, gas: EnergyCost) -> bool { ... }
```

Each test carries a `// REQ:` comment matching the contract's `P{N}-{domain}-{operation}` ID:
```rust
// REQ: P9-cns-energy-budget-can-proceed — energy budget check with resource boundary
#[test]
fn energy_budget_can_proceed_with_circuit_breaker() { ... }
```

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
CONTRACT: Write next contract →
RED:     Write next property-based test → fails
GREEN:   Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:
- One contract + one test at a time
- Only enough code to satisfy the current contract without violating constraining principles
- Don't anticipate future contracts
- Keep contracts focused on observable behavior
- Each contract includes all 4 layers: expect: with [P{N}] tag, constraining principles, behavioral specification
- Each contract and test carries its `P{N}-{domain}-{operation}` REQ tag

**Fuzz and system layers** follow the same tracer-bullet pattern when applicable:
- **Fuzz tracer bullet** (Testing Discipline §2.4, T6): For `pub fn` input surfaces that accept arbitrary data from external sources. Contract: precondition = "any input", postcondition = "does not panic". Use `catch_unwind` + proptest with unlimited input generation. Fuzz tests live in `tests/` at crate root.
- **System tracer bullet** (Testing Discipline §2.4): For cross-crate end-to-end workflows that span multiple `pub fn` boundaries. Write a single integration test in `tests/` that exercises the full vertical slice. Contracts chain through the call stack — `f`'s system test transitively verifies `g`'s contracts if `f` calls `g`.

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for refactor candidates:
- Extract duplication
- Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- Apply SOLID principles where natural
- Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- Run tests after each refactor step
- **Preserve `// REQ:` tags and all contract layers** — refactoring changes structure, not functional alignment or principle grounding

**Rule 6bis — Contract metadata must travel with the function.** When moving or renaming a function, the `expect:` field, `[P{N}]` goal-principle tag, and `[P{N}] Constraining:` annotations must travel with the contract. Loss of any of these fields is a REFACTOR violation — it severs the traceability chain.

**Rule 8bis — Verify extended contract metadata after each step.** Run:
```bash
grep -rn "/// REQ:.*expect:" crates/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l
grep -rn "/// \[P[0-9]*\]" crates/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l
```
Compare counts against pre-refactor counts. Any decrease means contract metadata was lost — revert.

**Contract evolution requiring user consent (P2):** If a contract's `expect:` field or goal principle changed during refactoring, this is NOT a pure refactor — it's a contract evolution requiring P2 affirmative consent. Flag such changes for human review.

**Refactor-safe contract evolution rule:** The `expect:` field is the ground truth. If the formal contract (`pre:`/`post:`) drifts from the user expectation, the contract is wrong, not the expectation. Weakening a precondition or strengthening a postcondition that causes `expect:` to no longer semantically match is a critical violation.

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

### 5. Verify

```bash
cargo test -p <crate>           # Run the specific crate's tests
cargo clippy -p <crate> -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo check -p <crate>          # Type-check
```

**Contract structure audit (v0.28.0):**
```bash
# Coverage audit (contract count vs pub fn count)
bash scripts/ci/contract-audit.sh --summary

# expect: field presence
bash scripts/ci/contract-audit.sh --expect

# [P{N}] goal-principle anchoring
bash scripts/ci/contract-audit.sh --principles

# [P{N}] Constraining: annotation completeness
bash scripts/ci/contract-audit.sh --constraining

# All modes combined
bash scripts/ci/contract-audit.sh --full
```

### 6. Functional Gap Check

After verification, compare tested behaviors against specification requirements:

1. **Call `spec/graph/query`** via the `hkask-mcp-spec` MCP server to retrieve all specs in scope
2. **For each spec**, check `is_complete()` — if false, the spec has unsatisfied criteria that may need tracer bullets
3. **Gaps** — spec requirements with no matching `// REQ:` tag — must be addressed:
   - Write a tracer bullet for the gap, OR
   - Document the gap in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` with a deferral rationale
4. **Call `spec/graph/coherence`** to check overall collection coherence and identify missing MDS categories

This step catches the "tested but wrong" problem (tests that don't validate real requirements) and the "untested requirement" problem (spec requirements with no coverage).

**Contract quality sub-check:** For each contract in scope, verify all layers with scoring:
1. **`expect:` quality** — Scored 0-3: 0 (missing), 1 (vacuous — restates function name), 2 (functional — describes user need), 3 (anchored — names motivating principle with rationale). Contracts scoring 0-1 are gaps.
2. **Goal principle alignment** — Does the contract's `[P{N}]` match the MDS category's default goal principle? Cross-reference with the MDS category mapping (Domain→P1, Capability→P4, Interface→P3, Composition→P7, Trust→P4+P2, Observability→P9, Persistence→P8, Lifecycle→P5, Curation→P8). Mismatches require rationale.
3. **Constraining completeness** — Which Magna Carta principles (P1-P4) are missing from `[P{N}] Constraining:`? A Trust category contract without `[P4] Constraining` is a P0 gap.
4. **Bidirectional verification** — Every gap is a missing or broken triple in the contract traceability graph (see `docs/architecture/contracts/contract-traceability.ttl`). Link 1 (Implementation→Contract) verified by `contract-audit.sh`. Link 2 (Contract→UserExpectation) verified by `expect:` semantic check. Link 3 (UserExpectation→GoalPrinciple) verified by principle alignment cross-reference.

### 7. CNS Feedback Integration

The TDD cycle is a pre-commit development activity. Post-deployment, the CNS provides runtime contract monitoring per Testing Discipline §7.3. CNS violations feed back into the TDD cycle as triggers for new tracer bullets:

1. **Contract violations** (`cns.contract.violated`) — A runtime contract assertion failed in production. This is a bug where the implementation violated a correct contract, or the contract was too weak to catch the violation. Open a tracer bullet to strengthen the contract to exclude the violation scenario, then fix the implementation. Per Testing Discipline §7.5, the contract now permanently guards against that class of bug.

2. **Coverage drops** (`cns.contract.coverage`) — Variety per domain fell below threshold. The seam watcher (`SeamWatcher::check_drift`) detected that tested behaviors no longer cover what the system actually does. Open a tracer bullet to restore coverage and ensure the contract is still the behavioral specification.

3. **Mutation escapes** — `cargo-mutants` (Testing Discipline §8.5 Q1) detected mutants the test suite didn't catch. Open a tracer bullet with a strengthened contract that excludes the mutation path.

**Principle:** Every CNS contract alert is a candidate tracer bullet. The loop: CNS detects a violation → TDD writes a contract + test that excludes it → implementation fixes it → CNS monitors the new contract.

**Check before closing a CNS alert:** Does the fix have a contract? Does the contract have a test? Is the test traceable to a spec requirement? If any answer is no, the fix is incomplete — the bug will recur.
